# PennApps_24f Tongue Analyzer

![Tongue Analyzer](/images/1.png)

## Project Description

We analyze tongue condition through a combination of visual inspection and data collection. Our application allows users to upload images of their tongues, which are then processed using advanced AI algorithms to assess various conditions. The analysis includes identifying color, texture, and other features that may indicate health issues. Additionally, users can provide information about their symptoms, which helps in generating a comprehensive report on their tongue health.
